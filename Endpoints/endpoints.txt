endpoints classes are just c# classes that does one job
like getting data, creating, updating


each class has one responsibility, can be reusable, can be tested, and does not know about http


so comparing javascript to c#
 controllers = express route
 endpoint class = js function
 dbcontext = db client
 
 
 
 set up flow when get request is called
 controllers: 
 - recieves http request
 - calls endpoint class
 
 endpoint class:
 - uses Dbcontext 
 - fetches tickets
 - applies logic and returns data
 
 contoller: 
 -wraps data in 200 OK
 - sends JSON
